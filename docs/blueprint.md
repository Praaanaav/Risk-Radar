# **App Name**: Readmission Risk Radar

## Core Features:

- Data Explanation Tool: Employ an AI tool that generates a plain-English summarization of the relevant data provided, prior to generating the final risk assessment and advice. This will clarify which of the inputs had the biggest effect on the assessment.
- Patient Data Input: Develop a user-friendly interface with input fields for patient demographics (age, gender, etc.), medical history (diagnoses, prior visits), and medication details.
- Risk Prediction Engine: Use AI to predict readmission risk based on patient data using a pre-trained model (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost) trained on the Healthcare Dataset from Kaggle.
- Risk Level Display: Generate a clear risk assessment (High/Low) for the patient.
- Personalized Recommendations: Based on model analysis, the tool should suggest personalized recommendations for risk mitigation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of calm and trust, important in healthcare applications.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop, ensuring readability and focus.
- Accent color: Teal (#26A69A) for important calls to action and highlights, adding a touch of vibrancy without overwhelming the user.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface, for a clean and modern user experience. Suitable for both headers and body text due to its legibility and neutral appearance.
- Use clear and intuitive icons, in a consistent style, to represent data inputs and recommendations.
- Employ a clean and structured layout to make input fields and risk assessment easily accessible.
- Use subtle transitions and animations (e.g., when the model is running) to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
